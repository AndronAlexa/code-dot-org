# We aren't currently using ActionCable, but this is where we would configure it.
# Here is the stock config/cable.yml from a new Rails 7.2 app:

# development:
#   adapter: redis
#   url: redis://localhost:6379/1

# test:
#   adapter: test

# production:
#   adapter: redis
#   url: <%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" } %>
#   channel_prefix: rails_app_production
