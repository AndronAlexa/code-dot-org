# Git LFS inclusion / exclusion is controlled by this file. Our approach is to:
# INCLUDE dirs in Git LFS broadly, and then EXCLUDE text file-types narrowly.
#
# Why whitelist? Once a large binary file is committed to LFS, it is VERY
# hard to remove it from the git history as it requires a history rewrite.
# Once merged to `staging`, that NNN MB file makes our git repo that much
# bigger forever".
#
# In contrast, if a text file is accidentally included in LFS, adding it back to
# the git tree is easy, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54119191.

# Include these "large static asset" and localisation dirs in Git LFS:
apps/i18n/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
apps/static/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/app/assets/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/config/locales/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
dashboard/public/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
i18n/locales/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
pegasus/sites.v3/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
pegasus/sites/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
shared/images/** filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# HOW TO EXCLUDE A FILE/FILES FROM AN LFS DIR:
#
# 1. Add a new exclusion pattern in THIS section
# 2. Run `git add --renormalize .` from the root of the repo
# 3. All files matching the pattern should show up new and uncommitted
# 4. Commit your .gitattributes changes and the new files.
#
# üôè be thoughtful when adding new files/patterns: once the files
# are in our git history, they take up space forever.
#
# Exclude these files from our Git LFS dirs:

# Small list of very common text file types to exclude from all LFS dirs:
*.css !text !filter !merge !diff
*.js !text !filter !merge !diff
*.html !text !filter !merge !diff

# Include these files / file types in Git LFS no matter where they occur:
